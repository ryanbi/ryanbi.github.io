Living in the information age is absolutely fantastic; where more information including mundane things can be obtained than ever before. If utilised properly everything can be accessed without any effort. That is why I decided to go “paperless” to store my paper belongings so they can be retrieved anywhere anytime with a simple search.

For years I stored my important paper certificates, receipts, membership information, and bank statements in a centralised folder binder. I liked that system because I knew that my important thing is there, and not cluttered somewhere else. After all, if you are living outside of your own country, you need to be organised. Who knows that you might need something kept in your original country? 
However, as time progressed the binder grew in size. The more things I stored, the more I have to sort out other things in another binder.
That is not good, because I have trouble throwing up things even unimportant ones. Perhaps I am a paper hoarder. Maybe I attached myself so much in my binder so anything must not go out. In any case, it feels good to think that my stuff is secure.

I decided that it needs to stop.

I decided that I need a digital folder, where I can hoard all those unimportant things that I will never see it again, and keep any other important certificates in one simple binder. Everything will be scanned and send to the cloud and can be retrieved anywhere anytime. Yes, the ultimate hoarder heaven.

First up I need a scanner for documents. Not a flatbed scanner. I bought a ScanSnap S1300 from Amazon and it performed flawlessly. I spent a week scanning all my stuffs and sorting them into piles of “keep” and “no keep”.

Second, I want them to be accessible anywhere. Therefore it means I have to look for a file hosting or a cloud provider. Amazon S3? Nah, too complex. Dropbox? It does not have in-content search and have no PDF thumbnails on the web. Evernote? It was okay however my document will be more than 1GB in size and they capped the amount you can send to them. Finally, I chose Google Drive since it is relatively cheap, good sync program, full in-content PDF search, thumbnails on the web, and amazing Android app.

The system is a simple one. ScanSnap will run the scan on a touch of the button, automatically OCR and save the PDF in a Google Drive folder, in which it will upload itself to the cloud the second it is there. Now when I scanned anything, I know that it will be safe and can be accessed anywhere.

As for now, I have reduced my paper folder into only original certificates and important things, and any other paper clutter were on the web. And it has saved me numerous times when I need to email my stuff at work or at the bank. It saved me when I need to apply for various stuffs in which they require a proof. And when they need a paper copy, I just print those from the web.
And the rest of the “no-keep” papers? They were recycled. Very green.
