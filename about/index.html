<H1>Hi! I''m Ryan!</h1>

<p>My full name is Ryanbi Pratama but you can call me Ryan, as it was easier to pronounce and remembered. I am a biological scientist and a casual programmer.</p>

<p>I earned my Bachelor's with Honours in Science from University of New South Wales in 2012 - specifically working on small molecules in cyanobacteria. Now, I am working on analysis of antimicrobial resistances and building data warehouse for microbiological database.</p>

<p>I am fortunate to have a couple of publications and presentations during my degree and during my time working as a Research Assistant. Some of those can be find in my <a href="publications.html">publications page</a>.<p>

<p>I enjoy finding out new things and looking out ways to incorporate them in my system.</p>

<p>I particularly a fan of various webcomics. Some of those that I enjoy include Sinfest, Cyanide and Happiness, QC, SMBC, xkcd, Dilbert, and Buttersafe.</p>

<p>I am also a casual web front/backend developer since I was 14, and have worked on various technologies like HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, MongoDB. This website is made in Jekyll and hosted on GitHub pages. Although I by no means an expert in those, as technologies change over time, it is essential to familiarise myself with those things. I have made various stuffs including an image board, a flight price comparison, various mIRC scripts.</p>
